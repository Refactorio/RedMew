local map_name = 'default'
return map_name

--[[
Replace the word default in the quotes above with the name of the map you want to play then save this file.
Names of some popular maps:
diggy
crash_site
beach
double_beach
grid_islands_rotated
triangle_of_death
rotten_apples

If you want to play beach, line 1 should look like:
local map_name = 'beach'

If default is left in place, you will get a vanilla world.
You can get the full list of map names by looking in map_names.lua
You can also use 'map_layout' to load that file and create custom layouts.
