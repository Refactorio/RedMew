# RedMew

RedMew is a Factorio community that hosts custom servers, maps in different shapes and sizes, scripted scenarios and
modded servers. All of the games hosted are available to the public and our community is meant for players of all skill
levels and experience. You can find out servers by searching for "RedMew" in the multiplayer lobby.

## The Community
You can join the RedMew community on Discord by visiting http://redmew.com/discord

To join a RedMew Factorio server, follow the following steps in Factorio:
 - From the main menu, press "Play"
 - In the next window press "Multiplayer"
 - Next select "Browse public games" (this requires a factorio account and may prompt you to log in)
 - In the list of "Browse games" you can filter for "RedMew" and you will see all RedMew hosted maps

> _Note_: Not every server in this list will be official. If you're in doubt, join our Discord and ask.
