Hello there script explorer!

With this you can add a "Fish Market" to your World
You can earn fish by killing alot of biters or by mining wood, ores, rocks.
To spawn the market, do "/market" in your chat ingame as the games host.
It will spawn a few tiles north of the current position where your character is.
